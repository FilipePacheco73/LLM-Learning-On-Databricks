# MAGIC Later sections of this notebook will leverage the DeepSpeed package. DeepSpeed has some additional dependencies that need to be installed in the Databricks environment. The dependencies vary based upon which MLR runtime is being used. The below commands add the necessary libraries accordingly. It is convenient to perform this step at the start of the Notebook to avoid future restarts of the Python kernel.

# MAGIC ### Question 1: Data Preparation
# MAGIC For the instruction-following use cases we need a dataset that consists of prompt/response pairs along with any contextual information that can be used as input when training the model. The [databricks/databricks-dolly-15k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k) is one such dataset that provides high-quality, human-generated prompt/response pairs. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's start by loading this dataset using the `load_dataset` functionality.

# COMMAND ----------

ds_raw = load_dataset('databricks/databricks-dolly-15k')['train'].train_test_split(test_size =.2, seed=42)

# MAGIC ### Question 3: Load and Configure
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The next task is to load and configure the tokenizer for this model. The instruction-following process builds a body of text that contains the instruction, context input, and response values from the dataset. The body of text also includes some special tokens to identify the sections of the text. These tokens are generally configurable, and need to be added to the tokenizer.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### Question 5: Setup Training
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## DeepSpeed
# MAGIC
# MAGIC As model architectures evolve and grow, they continually push the limits of available computational resources. For example, some large LLMs having hundreds of billions of parameters making them too large to fit, in some cases, in available GPU memory. Models of this scale therefore need to leverage distributed processing or high-end hardware, and sometimes even both, to support training efforts. This makes large model training a costly undertaking, and therefore accelerating the training process is highly desirable.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC As mentioned above, one such framework that can be leveraged to accelerate the model training process is Microsoft's [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00032.pdf). This framework provides advances in compression, distributed training, mixed precision, gradient accumulation, and checkpointing.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC It is worth noting that DeepSpeed is intended for large models that do not fit into device memory. The `t5-base` model we are using is not a large model, and therefore DeepSpeed is not expected to provide a benefit.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Environment Setup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The intended use for DeepSpeed is in a distributed compute environment. As such, each node of the environment is assigned a `rank` and `local_rank` in relation to the size of the distributed environment.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here, since we are testing with a single node/GPU environment we will set the `world_size` to 1, and both `ranks` to 0.

# COMMAND ----------

os.environ["MASTER_ADDR"] = "localhost"
os.environ["MASTER_PORT"] = "9994"  # modify if RuntimeError: Address already in use
os.environ["RANK"] = "0"
os.environ["LOCAL_RANK"] = "0"
os.environ["WORLD_SIZE"] = "1"

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Configuration
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There are a number of [configuration options](https://www.deepspeed.ai/docs/config-json/) that can be set to enhance the training and inference processes. The [ZeRO optimization](https://www.deepspeed.ai/training/#memory-efficiency) settings target reducing the memory footprint allowing for larger models to be efficiently trained on limited resources. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The Hugging Face `TrainerArguments` accept the configuration either from a JSON file or a dictionary. Here, we will define the dictionary. 

# COMMAND ----------
